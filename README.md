#  Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot (Part 2)

This is a C# console-based chatbot application developed for the **PROG6221** module. The chatbot aims to raise cybersecurity awareness by engaging users in a dynamic, interactive conversation about cybersecurity topics like phishing, password safety, social engineering, and more.

##  Features

- âœ… **User Greeting** with name capture and memory
- âœ… **Keyword Recognition** to respond to cybersecurity-related queries
- âœ… **Dynamic Responses** using a `ResponseGenerator` class
- âœ… **Sentiment Detection** to adjust responses based on user tone
- âœ… **Conversation Flow** for follow-up questions
- âœ… **Memory & Recall** (e.g., remembering user's name and interest)
- âœ… **Error Handling** for invalid or empty input
- âœ… **Formatted Console UI** using colored output for improved readability

##  How It Works

The chatbot is structured using the following key classes:

### `Chatbot.cs`

Handles:
- User input/output
- Conversation memory
- Sentiment detection
- Topic-specific response logic
- Chat history tracking
- Conversation flow and recall

### `ResponseGenerator.cs`

Provides:
- A dictionary of keyword-based responses
- Random response selection for varied interactions

### `SentimentDetector.cs`

Detects:
- Positive or negative user sentiment
- Adjusts chatbot tone accordingly (e.g., support or encouragement)

### `User.cs`

Stores:
- User's name
- Can be expanded for more profile-related data

## Example Interaction

```
Hi there! Whatâ€™s your name? John

Welcome, John! ðŸ‘‹

Ask me anything about cybersecurity (type 'exit' to quit):

You: How do I make a strong password?
ðŸ¤–: A strong password typically includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

You: tell me more
ðŸ¤–: Using a combination of characters makes it harder for attackers to guess your password...

You: thank you
ðŸ¤–: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with?

You: exit
ðŸ¤–: Stay safe online! Thank you for your time! ðŸ‘‹
```
